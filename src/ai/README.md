# AI World Editor — MCP (desktop)

The Electrobun desktop build can host a **local Model Context Protocol (MCP)** endpoint so external AI clients (Grok Build, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can inspect and edit **convex solid-model brushes** in the live map.

This is **not** available in the GitHub Pages / browser build.

## Start the server

1. Run the **desktop** app (`bun run desktop:dev` or a packaged Electrobun build).
2. Click the **MCP** icon on the **main toolbar** (rightmost control).
3. Click **Start server**.
4. Copy the **URL** (for example `http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp`).

No token or password is required. The server only listens on this computer (`127.0.0.1`).

## Connect Grok Build

In `~/.grok/config.toml` (or via `grok mcp add`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.aiworlded]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp"
enabled = true
```

Use the exact URL from the dialog if the port is not `18765`.

CLI equivalent:

```bash
grok mcp add --transport http aiworlded http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp
```

Keep the editor open with MCP started while Grok uses the tools.

## Coordinate system

- Three.js **right-handed**, **Y-up**
- Brush transforms are **model-local** unless a field is labeled world
- CSG operations: `additive` | `subtractive` | `intersecting`
- Brush **order** is evaluation order (first → last), depth-first over the hierarchy

## Solid hierarchy (outliner / CSG groups)

Solid models are trees, not flat brush lists:

```
solid_model
├── brush (additive | subtractive | intersecting)
├── csg_group (operation when the group combines into its parent)
│   ├── brush
│   └── csg_group
│       └── brush
└── brush
```

| Concept             | Details                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Solid CSG group** | Outliner folder under a solid. Combines its children as one compound, then applies the **group operation** into the parent.                                              |
| **Nesting**         | Groups may contain brushes and other groups. `parentGroupId` on brushes / groups is `null` when parented under the solid root.                                           |
| **Operations**      | Brushes: `set_brush_operation`. Groups: `set_group_operation`. Additive groups look like normal yellow folders; subtractive/intersecting show red/blue badges in the UI. |
| **CSG order**       | Evaluation walks the scene depth-first. Sibling order under a parent matters (`reorder_brushes` / `reorder_brush_relative` / `insertBeforeId` on reparent).              |

### Hierarchy tools

| Tool                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_scene_hierarchy`  | Full outliner tree (`solid_model` → `csg_group` → `brush`) with operations                                                                        |
| `get_solid_model`      | Flat brush list (evaluation order) **plus** nested `hierarchy`                                                                                    |
| `get_csg_group`        | One group: children, `parentGroupId`, operation                                                                                                   |
| `create_csg_group`     | Group `brushIds` / `groupIds` into a new compound (`parentGroupId`, `operation`, `name`). `parentGroupId` must not be a member or under a member. |
| `set_group_operation`  | Branch op on groups                                                                                                                               |
| `ungroup_csg_groups`   | Dissolve groups; children rise to the former parent                                                                                               |
| `reparent_solid_nodes` | Move nodes under model root or another group (`parentId`, optional `insertBeforeId`)                                                              |
| `rename_group`         | Outliner display name (undoable)                                                                                                                  |
| `add_box_brush`        | Optional `parentGroupId` to spawn under a group                                                                                                   |
| `duplicate_brushes`    | `brushIds` and/or `groupIds` (group clone keeps nesting). `createdIds` = brush ids; group uuids in `data.groupIds`.                               |
| `reorder_brushes`      | `brushIds` and/or `groupIds` → first/last among siblings                                                                                          |

**Brush-only tools (no `groupIds`):** `delete_brushes`, `select`, `mirror_brushes`, `find_brushes`. Find groups via `get_scene_hierarchy` / `get_csg_group`.

**Workflow example:** build wall pieces → `create_csg_group` with those `brushIds` and `operation: "subtractive"` → nest a cutter under that group with `add_box_brush` + `parentGroupId` (or `reparent_solid_nodes`) → `duplicate_brushes` with `groupIds` to copy the whole compound.

Same-solid only: reparent/group never moves a brush out of its solid model root.

## CSG: solid vs brush AABB (critical)

| Tool                                                 | What it measures                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query_point` / `query_overlaps` / `query_neighbors` | **Brush volume AABBs** — includes subtractive cutters as hits           |
| `explain_csg_at_point`                               | **Final solid or void** after ordered CSG (use this for doors/cavities) |
| `query_void_connectivity`                            | Approximate path between two voids (coarse grid; not navmesh)           |

**Default workflow (leave `invertedWorld` false):** space starts empty → additive brushes create solid → subtractive brushes carve holes **only where they overlap prior solid**. A floating subtractive that does not overlap an additive does nothing.

**Do not enable `set_inverted_world` for normal room shells / door cuts.** Inverted mode starts the universe solid so subtractives dig space (advanced).

**Doors:** use `add_opening` / `cut_opening` (subtractive boxes through walls), not `clip_brush`. Clip/split change **one brush’s topology** along a world plane (ramps, bevels, permanent cuts).

## Walls, rooms, openings (math)

| Piece            | Placement rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `place_wall`     | Centerline `from`→`to` on XZ. Box size `{thickness, height, length}`. Yaw = `atan2(dx, dz)` so local **+Z** follows the segment. Bottom = `baseY` (default 0).                                                                                                                                                          |
| `add_room_shell` | Exterior AABB `size`; `position` is center (default floor on y=0). Front wall at **+Z**, back **−Z**, left **−X**, right **+X**. Side walls are shortened so corners do not double-stack.                                                                                                                               |
| `cut_opening`    | Subtractive box; **position is the hole center**, `size` is full extents. No auto wall align.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `add_opening`    | Prefer **`targetBrushId`** = wall brush. Snaps cut to wall **midplane**, uses wall thickness as depth (+ small overcut), reorders cut **after** that wall. `sillHeight` = bottom of hole → center Y = sill + height/2. Doors skip bottom frame strip. **Axis-aligned walls only** (not diagonal `place_wall` segments). |

**Door example:** build room → `find_brushes` nameContains `wall_front` → `add_opening` with `kind: "door"`, `targetBrushId`, `sillHeight` = floor top, `size: { width, height }`, `position` along the wall (x/z of doorway center; y ignored when sillHeight set), `snap: false`.

### AI level-building tips

- **Names (brushes):** pass `name` on `add_box_brush` / `add_box_brushes`, or `rename_brush`, then `find_brushes` with `nameContains`.
- **Names (groups):** `rename_group` / `create_csg_group` `name`; locate with `get_scene_hierarchy` (not `find_brushes`).
- **Shapes:** `find_brushes` shape filter accepts `thin`/`pole`, `flat`/`panel`/`flag`, `tall`, `long`, `box`.
- **Place on pole:** `align_brush` with `mode: "top"`, `gap: 0` (optional `center: true`).
- **Exact coords:** `set_brush_transform` / `add_box_brush` with `snap: false` or `exact: true` so `-17.125` is not rounded to `-17`.
- **Assemblies:** `duplicate_brushes` with many `brushIds`, or `groupIds` for whole compounds; use `data.groupIds` after group clone. `mirror_brushes` is brush ids only.
- **Groups:** prefer `create_csg_group` + `set_group_operation` over flattening; inspect with `get_scene_hierarchy` before reparenting.
- **Nest under group:** `add_box_brush` with `parentGroupId`, or `reparent_solid_nodes` after create.
- **Math:** `calculate` with expressions like `"20+(0.5*12)"` — only `+ - * / ( )` and decimals.
- **Half extents:** `half_extents` for face centers when aligning openings or stacking props.
- **Preview:** `preview_transform` / `preview_new_box` return predicted world bounds without mutating.
- **Rooms:** `add_room_shell` then `add_opening` with **`targetBrushId`** on a wall brush (not bare `cut_opening` unless you compute midplane yourself).
- **Doors:** set `sillHeight` to the floor top; omit bottom frame automatically; do not enable mullions.
- **CSG order:** `add_opening` + `targetBrushId` reorders the cut after the wall; otherwise use `reorder_brush_relative` / `insertAfterName`.
- **Mirror:** X-mirror flips yaw to −yaw; Z-mirror uses π − yaw.
- **Solid/void:** always `explain_csg_at_point` before trusting space is empty or solid; AABB queries list cutter volumes too.
- **Subtractives:** must overlap additive solid (and evaluate after it) or they are wasted; `validate_solid_model` warns when they do not.
- **Clip/split:** world plane on one brush for bevels/splits — not a substitute for doorway CSG.

**Clip plane tips:** prefer `axis` + `distance` (e.g. cut at `y=0` with `axis: "y", distance: 0`). `keepFront: true` (default) keeps the **+axis** side.

**Transform tips:** use **degrees** (`rotationDegrees`, `rotate_brush.degrees`), not radians. When snap is on, positions and angles snap to the editor grid / rotation step (default 15°) unless you pass `snap: false`.

Solid mutations (including hierarchy create/reparent/rename/ungroup) are **undoable** via `undo` / `redo` and the editor history.

## Grey boxes: read the layout, then populate it

A **grey box** is a named, described box volume the user places to mark out where
a space goes and what it is for. Grey boxes are **planning volumes, not
geometry**: they never compile into a solid result and never export. They exist
so a level's design intent can be read and built against.

The workflow this enables:

1. `get_grey_box_graph` — one call returns every volume (id, name, description,
   center, size) plus how they connect: edges marked `derived` (the volumes share
   a face, with the shared opening's width, height, and area) or `authored` (the
   user stated a route such as an elevator or a one-way drop, with a label, note,
   and direction). Muted adjacencies and unresolved authored links come back
   separately so nothing is silently dropped.
2. Read each volume's **description**. That prose is the brief — role, mood,
   constraints. Build to it.
3. `get_grey_box` before building in a volume. Its `occupancy` field reports the
   solid models and brush count already inside, so you can tell an untouched
   volume from one you have already filled.
4. Author the geometry with the ordinary solid tools (`create_solid_model`,
   `add_room_shell`, `add_box_brush`, `cut_opening`, …), placing brushes inside
   the grey box bounds. Size doorways against the reported shared-face rect so
   spaces line up where the layout says they connect.

Notes:

- Derived connectivity is computed from real volume orientation, so rotated grey
  boxes work. Volumes meeting only at an edge or corner are **not** connected.
- Every grey box write tool is undoable through `undo`.
- `get_editor_context` reports `greyBoxCount`, and `get_scene_hierarchy` lists
  grey box nodes.
- Creating a grey box yourself is legitimate when the user asks you to block out
  a layout, but the usual direction is the other way: the user blocks out, you
  build.

## Not in this build

- **`capture_viewport` / `capture_section`** — need WebGL readback + image transport outside the AI folder.
- **Separate tag system** — use stable `name` strings instead of a second metadata channel.
- **Exact navmesh void paths** — connectivity uses a capped grid / line sample only.

## Architecture

- **Bun process** (`src/ai/server/`): hand-rolled Streamable HTTP + JSON-RPC
- **Webview** (`src/ai/client/`): `EditorApi` facade over existing solid commands
- Tool catalog lives in `src/ai/server/tool_definitions/`, one file per domain
- Bridge: Electrobun RPC (`startMcpServer` / `invokeEditorTool`)
- UI: main toolbar **MCP** button → simple dialog with Start / URL / Copy
